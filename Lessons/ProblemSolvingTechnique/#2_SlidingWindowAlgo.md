## Sliding Window Problem

The sliding window technique is a useful algorithmic approach that involves creating a window (or subarray) that slides over the input data to solve problems related to subarrays or substrings. This technique helps in reducing the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.

### How It Works
1. `Initialization:` 
Define the window's size or the initial positions of the pointers (start and end).
2. `Expand the Window:`
Move the end pointer to include new elements in the window and perform necessary operations.
3. `Shrink the Window:`
Move the start pointer to exclude elements from the window when certain conditions are met.
4. `Maintain and Update:`
Keep track of the required result, such as maximum sum, minimum length, etc.

#### Tips for Using the Sliding Window Technique
1. `Identify the Window:`
Determine the size or the nature of the window based on the problem requirements.
2. `Track Required Metrics:`
Keep track of necessary information like sum, count, or character frequencies within the window.
3. `Update Efficiently:`
Adjust the window size by moving the start and end pointers and update the metrics accordingly.
4. `Edge Cases:`
Consider edge cases such as empty input, small input sizes, or when no valid window exists.

By applying the sliding window technique effectively, you can solve many problems efficiently, reducing the time complexity and avoiding redundant calculations.
